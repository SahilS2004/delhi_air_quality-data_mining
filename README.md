# 🔍 Problem Statement
Delhi consistently ranks among the world’s most polluted cities. Using the "Delhi Air Quality Dataset" (Kaggle), we analyze how air quality varies over time, across seasons, and among pollutants. We also study the impact of policy interventions (odd–even rule, lockdowns, stubble burning) on pollution trends.

# 🎯 Research Objectives
1. Analyze long-term air quality trends in Delhi.  
2. Identify seasonal pollution spikes and their causes.  
3. Compare pollutant contributions (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃).  
4. Examine correlation among pollutants and station-wise variations.  
5. Evaluate impacts of major interventions (lockdown, Diwali, stubble burning, odd–even).  
6. Detect outlier months using interactive visualizations.  
7. Quantify how often pollutant levels exceed WHO limits.

# 🧪 Methodology Overview (Phase 1)
1. Data Collection → Kaggle dataset import.  
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 
   - Handle missing, duplicate, invalid entries.  
   - Standardize timestamps, numeric types, units.  
   - Add `year`, `month`, `season` columns.  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Time-series trends.  
   - Monthly/seasonal boxplots.  
   - Correlation heatmaps.  
   - Station comparisons.  
4. Interactive Analysis
   - Year-selectable boxplot for PM2.5 outliers.  
5. Documentation 
   - Insights, methods, and role division.

# 📆 Phase-wise Plan
| Phase | Focus | Deliverables | Lead |
|-------|--------|--------------|------|
| 1 | Understanding + EDA | Cleaned data, notebook, visuals, report | Manu |
| 2 | Predictive + Policy Impact | Forecasting, intervention analysis, final report | Sahil Sarawgi |

Leadership will rotate in Phase 2.

# 📊 Expected Outcomes
- Clear understanding of pollution patterns.  
- Identification of major contributors & event impacts.  
- Foundation for predictive analysis (Phase 2).
